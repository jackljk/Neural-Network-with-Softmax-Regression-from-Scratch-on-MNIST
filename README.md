# Instructions
1. main.py is the driver function that has to be run in order to run different set of experiments. You can run it by doing: `python main.py --experiment <fill me in>`.
2. If you want to run a function with custom hyperparameters, edit the config files in the config. The config files contain the following parameters: layer_specs, activation, learning_rate, batch_size, epochs, early_stop, early_stop_epoch, regularization_type, L2_penalty, L1_penalty, momentum, and momentum_gamma. 
3. In the individual config files, you can what the purpose of each individual config file is, so you can better understand the outputs.
